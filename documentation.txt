CS 1501 Project 3

In this project i used the books code for MaxPQ.java and MinPQ.java with some modification so that
it will work with the Apt class. I also use the books code for In.java, StdIn.java, and StdOut.java so
that the program can read from a file or the terminal. Since i didnt modify the books code for insert
and delete they are still at O(log n) and the delete min or max as well as min key for both max and min
are constant time since when the functions are called it only pulls from its first index in the heap.

I have also made my own campare methods for the books code to use inorder to compare the Apt class
by rent, square footage and by city.

AptTracker.java runs the program and needs the below files

	Apt.java
	AptCompare.java
	AptRentCompare.java
	AptSqftCompare.java
	AptMaxPQ.java
	AptMinPQ.java
	In.java
	StdIn.java
	StdOut.java
